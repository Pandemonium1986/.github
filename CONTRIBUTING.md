# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this :wink:

## Just do it

You can really make a difference by:

- [Making an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue). A well described issue helps a lot. (Have a look at the known issues.)
- [Making a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests) when you notice a code error or when you want to propose a feature.

I'll try to help and take every contribution seriously.

## Coding conventions

I use some conventions that I invite you to follow :

- I use [.editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org)
- I follow [conventional commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/)
- I have some [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/). Take a look at the [README](README.md) file
- I use [super-linter](https://github.com/super-linter/super-linter) for all my repositories.

If you want to contribute to a `github-action` pipeline please follow this [guideline](docs/github-actions.md).

If you want to contribute to a `ansible` playbook/role/collection please follow this [guideline](docs/github-actions.md).

Thanks for your attention !
